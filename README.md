# craigslit_webscraper
Following a tutorial to create a web scraper for craigslist that looks for cars that suit my criteria.

The tutorial link is posted below:

The tutorial provides a fairly simple workflow. Works as a good data scraper given how the author Riley Predum wrote the code. I will be making modifications to allow the web scraper to not only search for vehicles, but also send me emails with links to possible vehicles to purchase that meet my criteria. I will also have to host the bot on a server to allow for automatic timely searches and emails.
